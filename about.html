    Here's a little bit of information about me. 
      <ul>
      <li>I've lived in Arlington, Virginia for most of my life, but I was born in Michigan, and most of my family still lives there. Northwest Michigan is known for their cherries, so that might be part of the reason I love them.</li>
      <li>I read a lot, and have for most of my life. My favorite book of all time is "Strange the Dreamer" by Laini Taylor, which I first read when I was 13. Now, I have a tattoo referencing it, and a heavily annotated copy that lives on my bedside table. If you're interested, you can <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28449207-strange-the-dreamer">read the synopsis on GoodReads</a>.</li> </ul>
