      An instrumental version of "Love Song" by Lana Del Rey, one of my favorite songs of all time.<br>
      <br>Jo's monologue from Greta Gerwig's "Little Women" is one of my favorite monologues I've ever seen performed. I am still shocked that Gerwig didn't win the Oscar for best adapted screenplay. <br> <video width="640" height="380" controls><source src="LittleWomenJoMonologue.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> <br>

      Transcription of "Peter and the Wolf": <br>
      Narrator: My dear children, young and old, each character in this tale is represented by an instrument in the orchestra. The bird, via flute ( <i>upbeat flute solo</i> ), the duck by an oboe ( <i>slow oboe solo</i> ), the cat by a clarinet in a low register ( <i>low clarinet solo</i> ), the grandfather by a bassoon ( <i>slow bassoon solo</i> ), the wolf by horn ( <i>ominous horn solo</i> ), peter by the string instruments ( <i>upbeat strings</i> ), the shooting of the hunters by kettle drums ( <i>loud, harsh kettle drums</i> ). And now dear children, here is our story. Early one morning, Peter opened the gate, and went out into the big green meadow ( <i>upbeat strings ending in progressive scales</i> ). On the branch of a big tree sat a little bird, Peter's friend. "All is quiet!" chirped the little bird gayly ( <i>upbeat, high-pitched flute solo</i> ) ( <i>upbeat strings and flute duet</i> ). Soon, a duck came waddling around. She was glad that Peter had not closed the gate, and decided to have a nice swim in the deep pond in the meadow. ( <i>relaxed oboe solo</i> ) ( <i>brief upbeat flutes </i> ) ( <i>brief relaxed oboes</i> ) ( <i>brief upbeat flutes</i> ) ( <i>calm strings</i> ) [Background music of oboes, flutes, and strings solos] When the little bird saw the duck, he flew down, settled himself in the grass beside the duck, and shrugged his shoulders. ( <i>brief duet between strings and oboe</i> )
