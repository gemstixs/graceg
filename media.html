    An instrumental version of "Love Song" by Lana Del Rey <br>
    "Love Song" is one of my favorite songs of all time, and there's something about the instrumental that really captivates me. You can read the <a href="https://genius.com/Lana-del-rey-love-song-lyrics">lyrics here</a>. <br>

    Jo's monologue from Greta Gerwig's "Little Women" is one of my favorite monologues I've ever seen performed. I am still shocked that Gerwig didn't win the Oscar for best adapted screenplay. <br>
    <img src="storygraph.png" alt="A bar graph of the ratings out of 5 stars I gave to every book I read in 2023. The title of the chart is 2023 Book Ratings, the x-axis is Ratings out of 5 stars, and the y-axis is the number of books. The x-axis goes from 1 to 5 in intervals of 0.25, and the y-axis goes from 0 to 20 in intervals of 5." width="640" height="380" border="0"/> <br>
    My favorite hobby is reading! It's what I spend most of my free time doing. Between majoring in English, reading for pleasure, and working at a bookstore, I read a lot of books. I use the website <a href="https://thestorygraph.com/"> StoryGraph </a> to track my reading, which is where I pulled this data from. The graph shows that the most common rating I gave was 4 stars, and the average rating was around 3.5 stars.
